Participants worked in teams using registered apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeship, career and technical education, WIOA work-based learning, and employment data to develop research and data products informed by needs identified in the National Governors Association Policy Academy on Scaling Work-Based Learning. The program provided instruction on using big data tools including SQL and R. Participants received training on core data concepts such as record linkage, data visualization, and information quality.
