    "Record linkage is an important component of any analysis, unless you have a fictitious perfectly curated dataset with no messiness or missing variables, and especially when linking administrative records. Unlike survey data that allows for perfectly selected variables with some potential for messiness, administrative data is tailored to adminisitrative purposes (not academic). That means that we will not have all of the variables we ideally want, and it also means that the data can be messy (either missing responses or with variables that we may not quite understand or have at our disposal). While we may not directly address missing responses (more on indirectly addressing this in the inference lecture), we can enrich our data set by pulling in relevant information from other data sets. We will proceed to describe how to link registered apprenticeship participants and UI wage record data to create a panel of individual records over time. We also describe some of the issues that arise when linking records of various sorts."

    "## Mastering\n",
    "Unlike reference data that is consistent across states (NAICS, SOC), master data refer to the unique collection of persons, employers, or households served by each state.  A state can have many different references to the same real-world entity, and mastering is the processing of assembling a set that has one member (record) for each unique instance of an entity in the real world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This master record can merge attributes from multiple sources, resulting in a “golden record” with a higher completeness than is available in individual sources.  When multiple references to the same entity have different values, those differences are resolved through a process called survivorship in which decisions are made about which value to keep (most recent, most frequent, highest quality source, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, there can be multiple QCEW records for each employer, so the record with the highest total wages from the most recent quarter was selected for the surviving NAICS and County values.  This was chosen because the most recent employer location and industry is the most relevant for supporting current work-based learning policy, strategy, and consumer information.  The optimal survivorship strategy may vary based on the intended audience and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also simplify more complex logic during the load process in order to make analysis easier, more performant, and more consistent across products.  For example, in this query we are decoding the Multi Establishment Employer Indication (MEEI) to create a simpler flag for identifying which employers have multiple worksites/establishments reporting in a single record.  We sometimes wish to identify or exclude these from location-specific analyses since the location recorded is not necessarily the location of employment."

    "While loading the fact table, we added some attributes to support job-level employment analysis, particuarly when looking at retention.  Quarterly wages are reported if there is even one day of employment in a quarter, so it is helpful to know whether in individual was employed at the beginning of a quarter, the end of a quarter, or both (full quarter employment).  The three metrics below are based on the Quarterly Workforce Indicator definitions used by the U.S. Census Bureau, but they are restricted to the primary employer.\n",

    "Primary Employer End of Quarter Employment (**Primary_Employer_End_of_Quarter_Employment** in the above query) - This is a Y/N flag that evaluates as true if the Primary Employer is the same in quarters t (reference) and t+1 (subsequent).
