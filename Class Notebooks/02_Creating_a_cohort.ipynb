    "Now that you have been introduced to the datasets available for you in this training and have taken a sufficient amount of time to explore potentially relevant variables, you should be ready to begin mapping out the beginnings of your longitudinal analysis. This notebook introduces you to the concept of creating a group or a \"cohort\" that define the primary population of interest in much research. A cohort is a group of individuals that share a time-based characteristic. Within the focus of the training program, your cohort will consist of a population of registered apprenticeship program completers. Once created, cohorts may then be used to link to other data sources, such as employment data.\n",
