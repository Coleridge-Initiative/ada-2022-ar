    "This interactive guide serves as an overview of how a longitudinal analysis can be structured based on the dimension model generated from the code introduced in `03A_Linked_Dataset_Construction.ipynb`. It will also provide you with template queries you can modify to support your project analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each stage you will be modifying the code with the appropriate variable, function or SQL/R code snippet for your cohort and project goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this interactive guide, you will work through code:\n",
    "1. Reading your cohort constructed in `02_Creating_a_cohort_checkpoints.ipynb` and summarizing cohort characteristics from the resulting linked dataset in a table.\n",
    "1. Analyzing metrics trends across multiple quarters pre- and post-completion for a cohort of interest and displaying them in a line chart.\n",
    "1. Comparing metrics between two periods (completion and n quarters post completion) for a cohort of interest and displaying them in a bar chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL scripts for all three stages can be found in the Longitudinal Analysis Interactive Guide Queries subfolder.  You can copy these to your personal or team area for modification and viewing results in DBeaver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The purpose of this interactive guide is similar to that of previous checkpoint notebooks - we hope you to practice making changes to the code that will help construct your own research project. We have given examples, but these are more applicable to a generic research project.**"
